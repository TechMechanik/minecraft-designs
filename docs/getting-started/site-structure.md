# Site structure

- **Docs** are served from `/` (not `/docs`) to keep URLs clean.
- The sidebar is curated for predictable navigation.
- You can enable versioning later for modpack releases (ATM10 → ATM11).

## Recommended conventions

- One concept per page
- Keep commands in fenced code blocks
- Use headings to keep scrollable pages readable
