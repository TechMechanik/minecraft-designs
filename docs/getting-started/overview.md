# Getting Started

This site is organized like a wiki, but stored in Git so it stays versioned and portable.

## Editing

- Every page is a Markdown file under `docs/`
- Images go under `static/img/`
- Navigation is controlled by `sidebars.js`

## Adding a new page

1. Create a new `.md` file under `docs/`.
2. Add frontmatter (title + optional sidebar position).
3. Add it to `sidebars.js` (or use autogenerated sidebars later).
